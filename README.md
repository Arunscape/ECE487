# OSI Model

1) Physical layer
    - Reliable process-to process message delivery
    - Interface to transmission medium
    - Responsible for movements of individual bits from one hop (node) to the
      next
    - Physical connections
    - Data rate
    - Bit synchronization (achieved with preamble)
    - Neighbourhoods
2) Data link layer
    - Error detection and retransmission
    - Responsible for carrying data frames between adjacent nodes
    - Makes layer 1 appear error free to upper layers
    - Neighbourhoods
    - LAN
    - MAC (Physical addressing)
        - changes from hop-to-hop
3) Network layer
    - Route determination
    - handles packets
    - communication from sender to far away receiver
    - multiple hops
    - IP addressing
        - does not change hop-to-hop
    - Computer-to-computer
4) Transport layer
    - Error detection and retransmission
    - process to process communication (sender to receiver)
    - TCP
    - port addressing
        - does not change hop-to-hop
5) Session layer
    - Login and logout procedure
6) Presentation layer
    - Format and code conversion serrvices
    - translation, compression, encryption, decription
7) Application layer
    - Provides access to the end user
    - user interface

# Network topologies

- Mesh
  - number of ports:
  ![(n-1)n](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=(n-1)n)

  - number of links:
  ![\frac{(n-1)n}{2}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5Cfrac%7B(n-1)n%7D%7B2%7D)

- Bus

- Ring

- Star

# Definitions

## Full duplex vs. Half Duplex
- ethernet and WiFi is half duplex
- phone calls are full duplex


## Circuit switching vs. Packet Switching
- Circuit Switching 
- resources are reserved
- Packet Switching

|                            | Circuit Switching | Packet Switching |
|----------------------------|:-----------------:|:----------------:|
| Dedicated path             | ✅                | ❌               |
| Bandwidth available        | fixed             | dynamic          |
| Potential waste            | ✅                | ❌               |
| Store and forward          | ❌                | ✅               |
| Call setup                 | ✅                | ❌               |
| Congestion                 | at setup time     | on every packet  |
| Charge                     | per minute        | per packet       |
| Same route for all packets | ✅                | ❌               |

## LAN vs. WAN
- LAN is for short distance
- WAN can be simple or complex
    - telephone internet
    - the entire internet

## Specific addresses
![example 2.42](images/2.42.png)

## Hamming distance
- for a minimum hamming distance ![d_{min}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_%7Bmin%7D), up to ![d_{min}-1](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=d_%7Bmin%7D-1) errors can be detected.
- up to t errors can be detected, ![2t < d_{min}](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2t%20%3C%20d_%7Bmin%7D)

## Block coding
- data word
```
101|
010|
~~~
```
- code word (the entire thing including the parity)
```
101|0
010|1
~~~
111 1
```

An example where a 2d parity check canot detect a 6 bit error

![2d](images/2dparitycheck.png)

This is a type of linear block code

## Hamming Code
Given the parity check bits:

![hamming1](images/hamming1.png)

The syndrome is calculated:

![syndrome](images/hamming2.png)

![corrupted](images/hamming3.png)

## Cyclic code (CRC)
- also a type a linear block code
- each code is a cyclic bit shift of another code
- also, because it's a linear block code, every nonzero codeword is generated by
  XOR-ing 2 other codewords
```
         codeword
         ___________
divisor |dataword000
         ...
         ..
         .
        _____________
        syndrome bits
```

```
   Sending                                 Receiving

     1111                                 1111
     -------                              ------
1011|1101000                         1011|1101001
     1011|||                              1011
     ----v||                               ---
      1100||                               1100
      1011||                               1011
      ____v|                                ---
       1110|                                1110
       1011|                                1011
       ----v                                 ---
        1010                                 1011
        1011                                 1011
        ----                                  ---
         001                                  000

So, the dataword sent is 1101001
```

Received is accepted if syndrome bits are 000

## Checksum
- add everything up, and at the end add a negative term to make the sum 0

## IP Addresses
- Binary converter
    https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-bin

### Given a mask /15, and knowing one host is 24.32.12.56
- To find the first and last address, write it in binary.
- The first address is the (32-15=17) rightmost bits turned to 0
- and then the last one is those bits turned to 1
- https://www.calculator.net/ip-subnet-calculator.html?cclass=any&csubnet=15&cip=24.32.12.56&ctype=ipv4&printit=0&x=57&y=12
```
24.32.12.56 /15
00011000.00100000.00001100.00111000

First address
00011000.00100000.00000000.00000000
                ~.~~~~~~~~.~~~~~~~~
24.32.0.0

Last address
00011000.00100001.11111111.11111111
                ~.~~~~~~~~.~~~~~~~~
24.33.255.255
```

### Assigning an address block 16.0.0.0/8 with equal size subnets

- the total number of addresses is ![2^{32-8}=2^24](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2%5E%7B32-8%7D%3D2%5E24)
- so, the number of addresses for each subnet is ![2^24/1024=2^14](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2%5E24%2F1024%3D2%5E14)
- so, the subnet mask is 32-14=18
    - i.e. the first (leftmost) 18 bits are the mask
    - 255.255.192.0
- the mask for the entire block is 8, so the first 8 bits of all addresses will
  all start like 16.XXX.XXX.XXX, since we take the first 8 bits of 16.0.0.0
- so, the other 10 bits (18-8=10) determine the 1024 subnets
    - the first subnet
      ```
      16.00000000.00000000.0
      ##.~~~~~~~~.~~
      starts with 16.0.0.0

      16.00000000.00111111.255
      ends with 
      16.0.63.255
      ```
    - the last subnet
      ```
      16.11111111.11000000.0
      ##.~~~~~~~~.~~
      starts with 16.255.192.0


      16.11111111.11111111.255
      ends with 16.255.255.255
      ```

- Given HLEN, the total number of bytes in the header is HLEN * 4
- Offset is measured in units of bytes
